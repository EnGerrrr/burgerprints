<h3>USER AGREEMENT</h3>
<p>By violating this User Agreement in any capacity, you are subject to an immediate removal of your campaign(s),

  (the “Agreement”), the Intellectual Property Complaint Policy, the Counter-Notice Policy, the Repeat Intellectual

  are incorporated by reference.</p>
<h4>Delivery Procedure</h4>
<p>Any time quoted for delivery is an estimate only; provided, however, that BurgerPrints shall use commercially
  reasonable efforts to deliver all merchandise on or before the stated delivery date. No delay in shipment or delivery
  of any merchandise relieves Seller of their obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<h4>Print Variance</h4>
<p>Product production is generated from the artwork uploaded by the seller. The estimated positioning of the art work is
  provided by the seller. Print size and exact location may vary based on the product size. Colors are best matched to
  the artwork provided. BurgerPrints may substitute comparable products if stock becomes an issue. Exact print size,
  location, and colors are not guaranteed; and are completely dependent on the artwork uploaded by the seller.</p>
<h4>Price and Payment</h4>
<p>Seller shall determine the price of the merchandise sold for each campaign, BurgerPrints shall retain from the
  customer payments, BurgerPrints will determine the base price as the cost of goods sold (including any additional
  expenses and fees BurgerPrints determines necessary to comply with the terms of this Agreement), and remit to Seller
  any amount in excess of such base price (“Seller Profits”).</p>
